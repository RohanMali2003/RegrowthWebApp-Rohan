Readme:
Can I copy contents of a local repository onto a new git repo without having to link it to the main repo I have cloned?

Github code:
git remote add origin https://github.com/RohanMali2003/RegrowthWebApp-Rohan.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Does not work as intended

Readme for this has changed?
