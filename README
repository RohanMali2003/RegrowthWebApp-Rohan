Readme:
Can I copy contents of a local repository onto a new git repo without having to link it to the main repo I have cloned?

Github code:
git remote add origin https://github.com/RohanMali2003/RegrowthWebApp-Rohan.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Does not work as intended
Has shown error on vscode terminal. Will log soon.

Is it against company policy?
I have added my code to my branch but it does not show as a contribution
Maybe only edits made to Main branch add as a contribution
Starting the new year with a contribution streak! Yay!
not even 2 days in and I broke my streak. fml
oh well, guess I'll just live with it
