Readme:
Can I copy contents of a local repository onto a new git repo without having to link it to the main repo I have cloned?

Github code:
git remote add origin https://github.com/RohanMali2003/RegrowthWebApp-Rohan.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Does not work as intended
Has shown error on vscode terminal. Will log soon.

Is it against company policy?
I have added my code to my branch but it does not show as a contribution
Maybe only edits made to Main branch add as a contribution
Starting the new year with a contribution streak! Yay!
not even 2 days in and I broke my streak. fml
oh well, guess I'll just live with it
Second day i broke my streak :)
Somehow i only remember past 12
I need to set an alarm for this
Today i didn't code anything so I do feel a little guilty for doing this
Was busy with my new internship so couldn't spare time for coding today, will do tomorrow onwards

Fulfilled my daily target! Feeling good
Also, commits made on forks do not count?
I'm getting tired of just updating readme's to continue my streak
I should start a new project
I don't have the time now though
Definitely in Feb
Broke. my. streak. again.
by a single minute. so frustrating.
updating readme's is stupid
I've started a new project but it's slow work rn because I'm swamped
I should start uploading the changes on git
